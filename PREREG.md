# Pre-registration (598E)

This file is for 598E students; it is the second half of the 598E rider, and 498E students can ignore it or delete it.

A pre-registration is a claim you write down, with the test that will judge it, before you can see the answer.
Its value is that the claim can be wrong in a way anyone can check, and that you cannot adjust it afterwards to fit the numbers.
A well-powered result that says "no effect as large as the one I cared about" scores as well as a confirmation, so you have no reason to bend the claim.

**Git history is how I will know the order.**
Commit this file, filled in through section 4, before the first commit that puts a judgment line into `eval/own/qrels.txt`.
`uv run p2 check --final` reads `git log` to confirm it, and a copy that was committed afterwards fails.
You may ingest your corpus and write queries first, but not the relevance judgments.
After that first commit, do not edit sections 1 to 4.
If something must change, add a dated entry in section 6 and leave the original as it was.

You need your stage 1 scores for section 3, so score the shared corpus first.

## 1. Hypothesis

One sentence, about your own corpus, naming two of your systems and a direction.
For example: "On my corpus of Kubernetes documentation, `rerank` has a higher MRR@10 than `hybrid`, because the queries are paraphrases that a first-stage fusion ranks too low."
It should be something you could be wrong about.

TODO: your hypothesis.

---

## 2. The smallest effect that matters

Name one metric, MRR@10 or nDCG@10, and choose it now so you cannot pick the better one afterwards.
Then say how large a difference between the two systems would matter to a person using the search, and why that size.
A difference of 0.02 is usually not worth a reranker's cost in time and tokens; a difference of 0.10 might be.
Call your number Δ (delta).

TODO: your metric and your Δ, with the reason.

---

## 3. How many queries you need

The size of the gold set follows from three numbers: how large a difference you want to detect (Δ), how variable the per-query differences are (sd), and the usual choices of a 5% false-alarm rate and 80% power.

```
n = ((1.96 + 0.84) * sd / Δ)^2
```

Here sd is the standard deviation of the per-query differences between your two systems, which `results/results.json` holds for the shared practice queries.
Compute it from your stage 1 runs for the same two systems, or the nearest pair you have, and say which pair you used.
With only 20 practice queries the sd is itself noisy, so be generous and round up.

Two numbers to calibrate against.
At sd 0.3 and Δ 0.10 the formula gives about 71 queries, and with the t distribution's small-sample correction it is a few more, about 73.
At sd 0.3, a gold set of 30 queries can only detect a difference of about 0.15, which is why 30 queries cannot support a claim about a gap of 0.10.

After you score the own corpus, the minimum detectable difference that `uv run p2 score` prints for your two systems is this same calculation run the other way.
It should come out at or below your Δ.
If it does not, your queries varied more than your stage 1 sd suggested, and you will say so in the outcome.

TODO: your sd, which pair it came from, your n, and the number of queries you will write (at least n).

---

## 4. The test, and what each result will mean

The test is the paired 95% interval of the mean difference between your two systems on your own gold set, from the `own-pairs` table that `uv run p2 score` writes in `EVAL.md`.
Write the rule now.
This is the default rule, and you can tighten it, but do not loosen it after you see your numbers.

| The interval is | I will say |
|---|---|
| entirely above zero in the direction I predicted | supported: the difference is distinguishable from zero |
| entirely on the other side of zero | contradicted: the opposite of my hypothesis holds on this gold set |
| around zero, with both ends inside plus or minus Δ | well-powered null: a difference as large as Δ is ruled out |
| around zero, with an end beyond plus or minus Δ | inconclusive: the gold set could not settle it, and I say so |

TODO: confirm or tighten this rule, and name the two systems and the metric once more.

---

## 5. Outcome (write this after the fact)

What was the interval?
Which row of the table in section 4 is it?
Did your gold set reach the size section 3 asked for, and what was the minimum detectable difference that `uv run p2 score` printed?
What would you do next, and what would you want a reader to take from this?

TODO: your outcome.

## 6. Amendments

Dated entries only, one per change, each saying what changed and why.
Leave this section as it is if nothing changed.
